Object Oriented Programming Semester 2: Assignment 3

The problem asks us to create a guessing game where the answers are all yes or no, and implement it using binary trees. Firstly, we create a basic tree with some questions and answers and then we need to be able to ask the user for answers we donâ€™t have and to input questions to be able to differentiate these answers. We then also must be able to store this tree for the user and load it later if they want.
